====================
==== TASKSOLVER ====
====================

TaskSolver is a project whose task is to generate solutions to typical problems of higher and elementary mathematics.
The text of the solution is displayed in maximum detail, as if the problem was solved manually by a person.

This project is fully designed for Russian-speaking users. Multilingual implementation is not architecturally designed.
The multilingual implementation is not architecturally laid down and I will not develop it in the near future, sorry...
